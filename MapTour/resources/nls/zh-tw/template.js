Portrait orientation images can be used, but on smaller screens like the iPad a lot of the photo may be obscured by the caption (text takes up more space when it is displayed in a tall area compared to a wide area). Although images of different sizes, shapes, and orientation can be used in one Map Tour, we recommend using the exact same size and shape for all the images. In this way, the user won't be distracted by different sized images as they follow the tour_驗.",

It is also a good place to tell your audience the state or country that the tour is located in. For example don't assume that people know where the city or town in your tour is located. Your caption can also be formatted using HTML tags, such as including links. Don't make the caption too long though. In smaller browser windows or on the iPad it may not fit completely and be clipped. If you can't think of a good subtitle, leave it blank_驗.",
					div5: "試_Supporting Layers_驗",

These tags also help us at Esri to find cool new examples of tours we can showcase in our galleries and promote in social media. We also recommend that you upload a nice looking thumbnail graphic into your application item page, such as a small screenshot of the tour or one of the pictures from it.
