These images will be referenced in your Map Tour via their URLs.</li><li>You can also <b>upload photos from your computer</b> directly into your Map Tour. This upload option requires that you have an ArcGIS for Organizations account and that you have Publisher or Administrator privileges, because a hosted feature service is automatically created for you in which your photos are stored as attachments.</li></ul>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ž",

Portrait orientation images can be used, but on smaller screens like the iPad a lot of the photo may be obscured by the caption (text takes up more space when it is displayed in a tall area compared to a wide area). Although images of different sizes, shapes, and orientation can be used in one Map Tour, we recommend using the exact same size and shape for all the images. In this way, the user won't be distracted by different sized images as they follow the tour________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ž.",
					div2a: "Č_We recommend a maximum image size of 1000 pixels wide x 750 pixels tall for the main pictures and 140x93 for the thumbnails______________________________________ž.",

					div4a: "Č_Write a good subtitle for your tour____________ž",
					div4b: "Č_Take time to write a compelling subtitle for your tour. The subtitle is a good way to draw people into your tour and tell them what they will discover in it. It is also a good place to tell your audience the state or country that the tour is located in. For example don't assume that people know where the city or town in your tour is located. Your caption can also be formatted using HTML tags, such as including links. Don't make the caption too long though. In smaller browser windows or on the iPad it may not fit completely and be clipped. If you can't think of a good subtitle, leave it blank_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ž.",
					div5: "Č_Supporting Layers______ž",
					div6: "Č_You can add additional supporting layers to provide context to the Map Tour. These layers may contain other geographic features you want the map to show in addition to the Map Tour points, such as a study area, a walking or driving route linking your tour points, etc. The Map Tour template displays these additional supporting layers using the symbology you specify in the web map, but the popups aren't available______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ž.",
					div7: "Č_Keep your tour short and sweet__________ž",
					div8: "Č_There's a limit of 99 points per tour. Most Map Tours will of course be significantly shorter than this. Don't expect your audience to want to step through too many tour points. You might find your subject fascinating, but don't assume they will, too____________________________________________________________________________ž!",
					div10: "Č_Embed mode____ž",
					div11: "Č_If you want to embed the template in another website through an iframe, adding the optional parameter \"&embed\" at the end of the URL will remove the header. That mode can also be set in the downloadable version through the configuration file__________________________________________________________________________ž.",
					div12: "Č_Avoid using a narrow iFrame width that causes the map tour to switch to its responsive small screen touch-based layout. To maximize ease of use. When you embed a map tour, we always recommend still providing a link next to the embedded tour so that users can launch the tour full-screen_______________________________________________________________________________________ž."

These tags also help us at Esri to find cool new examples of tours we can showcase in our galleries and promote in social media. We also recommend that you upload a nice looking thumbnail graphic into your application item page, such as a small screenshot of the tour or one of the pictures from it. This picture is used automatically if your map tour is added into an ArcGIS Online gallery____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ž."
