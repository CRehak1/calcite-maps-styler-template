#Features
Elevation Profile is a configurable application template used to display the elevation profile for a selected feature or a measured line along with a web map. This template uses the [Profile geoprocessing service](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3300cfc33ca74a9fac69d2e0f4ea46e5) to generate the elevation values along the profile. View the [Profile service developer documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/rest/elevation/api-reference/profilesync.htm) for additional details.

This template can be configured using the following options:

- **Map:** Choose the web map(s) used in the application.
