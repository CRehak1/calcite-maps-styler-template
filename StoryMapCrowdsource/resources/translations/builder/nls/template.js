To avoid this situation you can convert any supporting layers to feature layers before adding them to your map and use simple symbols. 2) There is also a possibility that the data model for the crowdsource layer may change. If this occurs, we intend to provide a workflow or tool to update your layer to the new data model.'

              response: 'Yes, you can add other layers to the map for context, but first read the previous question for important information about doing this with the beta release of Story Map Crowdsource. Open your story\'s <% map %>, add layers, and save your changes. The next time you load your story you will see the new layers. Be careful not to delete or modify the contributions layer in your map or your Crowdsource story may stop working properly.'

              question: 'Where are are the photos stored?',

              question: 'Do people need an ArcGIS account to contribute to my Crowdsource story?',
